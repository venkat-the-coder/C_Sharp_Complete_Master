Compilation:
	every code that we are writing is simply a text file which cannot be understand by a computer
	that can be cokmpiled to make it understand 
	a process of coverting a source code into a machine understanding format is called compilation
	.cs file to .dll file

Build:
	once after build process files generated in bin folder once after cleaning solution it will be removed
	those files are executables after build we can shre it to anybody
	there we have follwoing files:
		.exe it is an actual application
		.dll Dynamic Link Library
